To Do:

Need to do (immediate): Correlation between attributes --> Identification of key attributes --> Removal of unecessary attributes (dimensionality reduction)
Phase 2: Ideal number of clusters, step-wise regression, add clusters as a variable --> Test the stability, accuracy/effictiveness
Phase 3: Try to improve? Scrape additional cars, cross-validate/folds. Manually handicap/augment some variables?

1.	A basic multiple linear regression (performed step-wise for dimensionality reduction).
2.	Classification/clustering, the cars will be categorized into different clusters.
3.	Classification/clustering, the cars will be categorized into different clusters. Then we will create a variable to represent the different classes/clusters. We can then apply linear regression; having accounted for cars of similar classes/archetypes.
4.	We will apply this model to both position and time. A total of 6 models.
5.	We may also have a recommender system, where based from the lap time desired (and some other characteristics), we can recommend specific metrics to meet that goal.


Final: Interpretation and visualizations, use tableau, write report.
Must explain differences between time and position, time is objective and the standard of measurement, position is relative, but still important for this exercise (need to argue)
