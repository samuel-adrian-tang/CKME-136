To Do:
Main Research Questions?
1. What can positively affect a car's laptime?
A) Does Horsepower?
B) Does Weight?
C) Does Year?

Use the asteriks symbol instead which could help with pair-wise (instead of plus sign)
    

Final: Interpretation and visualizations
-----------------------------------------

REPORT: Issues, decisions, tuning, process, outcome and interpretations
Must explain differences between time and position, time is objective and the standard of measurement, position is relative <- May lead to overfitting
Why was Spearman chosen? Parametric versus non-parametric

Multiple methods for feature selection, should employ more methods
    https://www.machinelearningplus.com/machine-learning/feature-selection/
Multiple methods for modeling, MLR, Stepwise, not linear????
Dummy variable trap <- still want to see individual effects of each though.....Drivetrain and Engine Augmentation and Engine Layout
Multicollinearity <- is multiple LINEAR regression the best/correct way to do this? Does it violate assumptions? Heteroskedacity

    https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/olsrr/vignettes/intro.html <- use olsrr to check!!
Why clustering? Body style, and other stuff can be useful for this.....clustering helps to capture some of the stuff that may put some cars in the same class. 
    This is what the auto industry naturally does anyways. Allows for better comparison?
    Not that it is apples to oranges....but more like grapefruit to oranges?
    Create clusters according to time? (benchmarking)
Clustering will help with outlier treatment, Pros and Cons of removing outliers:
    Cars are designed and exist in extremes, it is not unusual perse to have an outlier
    May employ traditional outlier treatment as a hypertuning operation... Must compare performance
Model Analysis
    Notice the difference in errors between high ranking and low ranking, meaning it is more like a second difference function
