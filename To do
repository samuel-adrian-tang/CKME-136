To Do:

(x) 1.	A basic multiple linear regression (performed step-wise for dimensionality reduction).
(x)     A) Need to investigate comments from before (Is Supercharger actually important??? Investigate more)
        - Torque appears to be stronger (as it is more related to accelaration), HP is stronger for speed (top speed, maintaining speed)
        - Year relates to other tech advances (gearboxes, suspension, aero, etc.)
        - Weight is still important, can be used for classifying (along with other things), but very clearly impacts time
        - Cylinders affects HP and Torque... (compare averages)
        - Engine layout (compare averages)
        - Drivetrain (compare averages)
2.	Classification/clustering, the cars will be categorized into different clusters.
    A) Ideal number of clusters, add clusters as a variable
    B) Test the stability (overfitting/underfitting), accuracy/effictiveness (need 3 different measurements)
    C) Run MLR/Stepwise testing again
3.	Try using different modelling techniques --> 
    A) Try to improve? Scrape additional cars, cross-validate/folds. Manually handicap/augment some variables?
    B) RESEARCH CROSS-VALIDATION METHODS
    
    

Final: Interpretation and visualizations
-----------------------------------------

REPORT: Issues, decisions, tuning, process, outcome and interpretations
Must explain differences between time and position, time is objective and the standard of measurement, position is relative <- May lead to overfitting
Why was Spearman chosen? Parametric versus non-parametric

Multiple methods for feature selection, should employ more methods
    https://www.machinelearningplus.com/machine-learning/feature-selection/
Multiple methods for modeling, MLR, Stepwise, not linear????
Dummy variable trap <- still want to see individual effects of each though.....Drivetrain and Engine Augmentation and Engine Layout
Multicollinearity <- is multiple LINEAR regression the best/correct way to do this? Does it violate assumptions? Heteroskedacity

    https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/olsrr/vignettes/intro.html <- use olsrr to check!!
Why clustering? Body style, and other stuff can be useful for this.....clustering helps to capture some of the stuff that may put some cars in the same class. 
    This is what the auto industry naturally does anyways. Allows for better comparison?
    Not that it is apples to oranges....but more like grapefruit to oranges?
Clustering will help with outlier treatment, Pros and Cons of removing outliers:
    Cars are designed and exist in extremes, it is not unusual perse to have an outlier
    May employ traditional outlier treatment as a hypertuning operation... Must compare performance
