Lap Times at the Nurburgring

As a car enthusiast, I am often looking for the latest trends in motorsport engineering. I have always wanted to combine my passion for data and motorsport.That is why I have chosen this “Top 100 Nürburgring” dataset. 
The dataset and problem that I am targeting to solve is a model to predict lap times at the famous Nordschleife – Nürburgring. This model will be built using Chris Scott’s Kaggle dataset, which features the top 100 laptimes for cars up to the model year 2017. Some of the determinants recorded are Model Year, Car Make, Car Model, and Lap Time. Other features such as Engine Size/Displacement, Engine Placement, Horsepower, Transmission, Temperature, etc. will be considered and added.
By creating this model, I hope to discern what are the greatest influencers to laptime and how car manufacturers can better improve their cars. Another hope is to create an accurate lap time predictor given as much information as possible with these indicators. 

I will be using R to manipulate the data, and to build the model. Afterwards, illustrations and graphics will be visualized using Tableau.
