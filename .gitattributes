#basic summary and visualization, prelim analysis, w/ Time
summary(cleandata)
plot(cleandata$Time)
plot(cleandata$Position, cleandata$Time) #Direct relationship
plot(cleandata$Year, cleandata$Time) #weak negative relationship, represents other technological improvements, difficult to dissect
plot(cleandata$Make, cleandata$Time) #no clear relationship, there is little information to glean from this variable
plot(cleandata$Model, cleandata$Time) #no relationship, purely for the purposes of identification
plot(cleandata$Weight, cleandata$Time) #no clear relationship - Maybe important for clusters? May be useful to group into different seqmants
plot(cleandata$Turbocharger, cleandata$Time) #no clear relationship - must compare the three engine augmentation styles, Turbo, Super, Hybrid (Position, Time, Weight, HP, Torque)
plot(cleandata$Supercharger, cleandata$Time) #no clear relationship - must compare the three engine augmentation styles, Turbo, Super, Hybrid (Position, Time, Weight, HP, Torque)
plot(cleandata$Hybrid, cleandata$Time) #no clear relationship, only two examples - Need to explain advantages (torque+HP > weight?, prove by kg/hp?)
plot(cleandata$Powertrain, cleandata$Time) #V8 most popular, investigate averages (HP, Time, Position, weight) for each group
plot(cleandata$Engine_Layout, cleandata$Time) #no clear relationship investigate averages for each group
plot(cleandata$Horsepower, cleandata$Time) #weak negative trend - why is it not as obvious/strong?
plot(cleandata$Torque, cleandata$Time) #weak negative trend - why is it not as obvious/strong?
plot(cleandata$Drivetrain, cleandata$Time) #RWD most popular, inherantly by design, AWD is heavier but better traction
plot(cleandata$Body_Style, cleandata$Time) #Coupe is most popular, inherantly by design...lighter weight, investigate correlation between weight?
plot(cleandata$Manual_Transmission, cleandata$Time) #Manual transmission may increase time, investigate averages for groups
plot(cleandata$KGperHP, cleandata$Time) #Positive trend, ressembles a logarithmic function
plot(cleandata$Cylinders, cleandata$Time) #Weak negative trend, investigate averages for each group

#basic summary and visualization, prelim analysis, w/ Position (many comments similar to above, **indicates further revelation)
plot(cleandata$Time, cleandata$Position) #Direct relationship
plot(cleandata$Year, cleandata$Position) #weak negative relationship, need to explain manufacturing and car cycles/generations **
plot(cleandata$Make, cleandata$Position) #no clear relationship
plot(cleandata$Model, cleandata$Position) #no clear relationship
plot(cleandata$Weight, cleandata$Position) #no clear relationship, why? Can it be easily offset/countered? **
plot(cleandata$Turbocharger, cleandata$Position) #no clear relationship, appears to be two clusters **
plot(cleandata$Supercharger, cleandata$Position) #no clear relationship
plot(cleandata$Hybrid, cleandata$Position) #no clear relationship, only two examples
plot(cleandata$Powertrain, cleandata$Position) #V6 appears to have best average position, I4 is terrible (probably because of the cars it is paired with) **
plot(cleandata$Engine_Layout, cleandata$Position) #Mid-Engine appears to have lowest average position, no clear picture, need summary statistics based from groups **
plot(cleandata$Horsepower, cleandata$Position) #weak negative trend
plot(cleandata$Torque, cleandata$Position) #weak negative trend, clearer picture than horsepower **
plot(cleandata$Drivetrain, cleandata$Position) #AWD and RWD appear to have similar effects, however, need to differentiate using weight...? **
plot(cleandata$Body_Style, cleandata$Position) #Coupe is most popular and usually perform better (boxplot visualizations are much easier to interpret) **
plot(cleandata$Manual_Transmission, cleandata$Position) #Manual transmission may increase position, investigate more
plot(cleandata$KGperHP, cleandata$Position) #Positive trend, ressembles a logarithmic function
plot(cleandata$Cylinders, cleandata$Position) #Weak negative trend, 6 features one major cluster, 8 features two? **



#Need to do (immediate): Correlation between attributes --> Identification of key attributes --> Removal of unecessary attributes (dimensionality reduction)
#Phase 2: Ideal number of clusters, step-wise regression, add clusters as a variable --> Test the stability, accuracy/effictiveness
#Phase 3: Try to improve? Scrape additional cars, cross-validate/folds. Manually handicap/augment some variables?

1.	A basic multiple linear regression (performed step-wise for dimensionality reduction).
2.	Classification/clustering, the cars will be categorized into different clusters.
3.	Classification/clustering, the cars will be categorized into different clusters. Then we will create a variable to represent the different classes/clusters. We can then apply linear regression; having accounted for cars of similar classes/archetypes.
4.	We will apply this model to both position and time. A total of 6 models.
5.	We may also have a recommender system, where based from the lap time desired (and some other characteristics), we can recommend specific metrics to meet that goal.


#Final: Interpretation and visualizations, use tableau, write report.
#Must explain differences between time and position, time is objective and the standard of measurement, position is relative, but still important for this exercise (need to argue)
